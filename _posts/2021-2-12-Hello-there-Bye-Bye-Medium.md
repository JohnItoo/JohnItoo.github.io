I have a few blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@itoohue) but the obtrusive nature of notifying "followers" about new writeups doesn't really sit right with me.
I hope to write new stuff about common easy techniques for problem-solving. 

When one solves a problem they haven't solved before, it is often advised to reflect on steps taken to solve that problem and thereafter,  hold that technique in memory. This is because there is a likelihood that there are other problems out there, past, present, or future that can be solved with the same technique.


I try to document these topics and keep a list of problems that can be solved with a particular technique. I already have very little stuff scribbled out on some old notes, but I desire to use this blog as some sort of notepad as I really need to throw the old hardcopy ones out.

As hinted in the video above, apart from logic and thinking abilities which differ from person to person, a good memory is very important in problem-solving as is the case in some individuals on the autistic spectrum, This helps in recollecting similar problems and how to solve them. I think a good reference such as this that can serve as a memory bank can augment memories like mine.


From time to time, I might also talk about some random stuff here and there.

I am doing this just as a personal reference but chances are if you aren't me reading this, you are checking this space out and I hope you have a great time going through / skimming this blog.
Let's get it!
