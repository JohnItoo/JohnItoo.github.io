<p>is where I come to air my thoughts and note down techniques and ideas for future reference.</p>

<p>Hello!. My name is John Ohue and I am a Software Engineer.</p>

<p>I hope to keep the blogs section of this site as a notepad of some sort. I have experimented with Medium and Blogspot. Hopefully, this would be around for a while.</p>
