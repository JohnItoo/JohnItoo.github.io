### This blog
is where I come to air my thoughts and note down techniques and ideas for future reference.

 Hello!. My name is John Ohue and I am a Software Engineer. 

I hope to keep the blogs section of this site as a notepad of some sort. I have experimented with Medium and Blogspot. Hopefully, this would be around for a while.
